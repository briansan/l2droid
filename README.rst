title: Learn to Android
by: bk
description: a compilation of mini-Android mobile applications that I wrote for my course in Android app development.

notes:
- all assignments were developed using android studio
  - for that reason, the first assignment is empty because it was written under eclipse.
- while all the numbered assignments were also completed by my peers, the final project is unique to the work of the other students in the class
